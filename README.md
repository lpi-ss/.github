# Let's Party: ServerSide Project
-# LPSS Project
This organization contains all scripts made for Let's Party Infinite (by FoxBin), that can be related to the Roblox's ServerSide industry.
These scripts ARE **NOT SERVERSIDE, SS**, these scripts ARE **FE**, meaning they exploit RemoteFunctions and RemoteEvents to replicate the stuff happening on your screen to others.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most scripts require you to have F3X in your inventory, and they rely on a third-party library called Prim, which creates an interface to work with the F3X SyncAPI (RemoteFunction for replication).

> [!NOTE]
> This organization __DOES NOT__ contain regular-use scripts such as Midnight. What scripts are explicitly included has been explained earlier.
